   ###   Objectives
   Make a working Hangwoman game. Complete with replay and instructions. 
   I chose to have two different wordlists, one easy and one hard. 
    
   ###    Changes throughout the process
   Considered adding a colour scheme but it didnt look right to me. 
  
   ## Features
   ####    Welcome page
   Welcome! Would you like instructions? Press Y for Yes and N for No.
   ####     Instructions
   To play hangwoman, you need to guess the word one letter at a time.
   Press a letter and hit enter. If correct it gets added to the word.
   If your guess is wrong a part of the hangwoman image will be added.
   Keep guessing until you get the whole word or you run out of tries.
